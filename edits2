  Go to this page and download   InfraRed  Libraries for your  Project  <   github.com/shirriff/Arduino-IRremote  >.
  
       COMPONENTS : :   IR receiver , Old TV remote  ,arduino uno /nano  , breadboard , wires .
       
       
       WORKING / ALGORITHM 
 1.  Find out  the useless/not used   button on your remote 
 
 2.  Hook up the  IR Reciever  , connect and configure with your arduino  . you must input  #include <IRremote.h> in 
     your program code
 
 3.  Try one example to make sure receiver is connected properly 
 
 4. open the arduino Serial monitor and press the button you want to use . 
    Then the serial monitor  Outputs a HEXADECIMAL  number onto screen  (eg . 0x345233.) 
 
 5. note down the hex numbers assosiated with your  input buttons 
 
 6.  now that you know the  configurations . connect different devices to your  
     arduino  and use  if/else  or switch  statement to check your  input 
     so as to operate different devices  wirelessly
